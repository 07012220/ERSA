     <p> Coming from the amalgamation of two Greek words – ‘protos’
    for first and ‘lithos’ which means rock, protolith means the original
    rock from which the current existing rock was created. It signifies a
    beginning, the dawn of something new and exciting. It signifies the
    start of something wonderful that will be remembered for days to
    come.   
  <p>And it is with this belief that we, the students of IIT Bombay,
    are proud to be bringing you the first national level festival of the
    IITB Earth Sciences Department, protolith.
    The field of geology is rarely known outside the circles of those
    who deal with the mysteries of the Earth. protolith is aimed at bringing this science to the fore and motivating the youth of our country
    to embark upon careers in it. However, it is not just a means to increase the awareness about the geosciences.  
  <p> It is also an opportunity for the current students to showcase their skill and talent in various competitions and challenging tasks. This festival is also intended to bridge the gap between the industry and the academics by increasing the interaction between them.
    Most importantly though, protolith is envisioned to provide a
    platform for young minds to mingle and come up with ideas that we
    believe can revolutionize this amazing branch of study. It symbolizes
    our hope that there is no barrier between disciplines of this field and
    our hope that together we can be stronger and better than what we
    are alone.
