  <p>Founded in 1917, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists is currently the world's largest  professional geological society with &ldquo;chevron&rdquo; as its premier sponsor.  </p>
  <p>The IITB student chapter was started in 2010. We have long been actively linked to AAPG. The  original purpose of AAPG, to foster scientific research, to advance the science of geology, to  promote technology, and to inspire high professional conduct, still guides the Association  today.AAPG provides publications, conferences, and educational opportunities to geoscientists and  disseminates the most current geological information available to the general public. As the world's  premier professional association for explorationists, AAPG is about the science of petroleum  geology.It's also about the people. AAPG's membership is made up of more than 40,000 members in  129 countries in the upstream energy industry who collaborate – and compete – to provide the  means for humankind to thrive. AAPG provides the network of communications that allow those  professionals to succeed.  </p>
